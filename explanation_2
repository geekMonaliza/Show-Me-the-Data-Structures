Time complexity
===============
For every level of the folder hierarchy we execute the for loop only for the items at that level.
If there are total of n items (files and folders) in the file system, there's only a part of that number
in each folder and all of the items in every folder sum up to n.

Time = O(n)


Time complexity
===============
we allocate a single File object for every file/folder in the current path.
It is actually equal to the maximum depth of folder hierarchy because you keep the File objects at every level until the next
level recursive call finishes but release them only after that. In the worst case the folder hierarchy can be O(n) deep - when
there is only 1 subfolder and no files in each subfolder. This gives you an O(n) space complexity.

Space = O(n)
