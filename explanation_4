We're storing member users and groups in array.
Adding user/groups to group is adding element to array.
time/space = O(n)



For every level of the group hierarchy we execute the for loop only for the items at that level.
If there are total of n users/sub-group in that level, there's only a part of that number
in each group.

Time = O(n)


we allocate a single group object for every sub-group in the current group.

Space = O(n)
